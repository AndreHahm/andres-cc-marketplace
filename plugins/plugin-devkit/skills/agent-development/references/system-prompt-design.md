# System Prompt Design Patterns

Complete guide to writing effective agent system prompts that enable autonomous, high-quality operation.

**R18 exception (recorded):** several structure/pattern blocks below intentionally exceed the rulebook's 30-line code-block threshold — each is a complete, coherent system-prompt skeleton meant to be read and copied as a whole; splitting one into multiple blocks would break the pattern it's illustrating.

## Recommended Structure: Role → Process → Output Format

As a baseline, structure agent system prompts in **Role → Process → Output Format** order:

1. **Role** — who the agent is and what domain it specializes in
2. **Process** — the concrete steps it follows to complete its task
3. **Output Format** — the exact shape of what it returns

This ordering gives the agent its identity before its instructions, and its instructions before the format it must produce — a predictable pattern that's easy for both authors and reviewers to check. It's a recommendation, not a mandatory schema; the fuller structure below adds optional sections for more complex agents.

### CO-STAR: A Finer-Grained Lens for User-Facing Agents

Role → Process → Output Format is the right baseline for most agents in this plugin — the ones that return structured findings or data to a caller. For an agent whose output is itself user-facing prose (a tone or audience-sensitive response, not just structured data), the six-part **CO-STAR** framework adds finer control than Role/Process/Output alone captures:

| CO-STAR element | Maps to (or extends) | Ask |
|---|---|---|
| **C**ontext | Background the agent needs — often folded into Role | What does the agent need to know before it can act? |
| **O**bjective | The Process section's goal | What is the agent trying to achieve? |
| **S**tyle | New — not covered by Role/Process/Output | What writing style — formal, casual, technical? |
| **T**one | New — not covered by Role/Process/Output | What attitude — encouraging, neutral, urgent? |
| **A**udience | New — not covered by Role/Process/Output | Who reads the output, and what do they already know? |
| **R**esponse | The Output Format section | What exact shape should the response take? |

Use CO-STAR's Style/Tone/Audience questions as an *addition* to Role → Process → Output Format when the agent's output quality depends on getting those three right (e.g. a user-facing report-writing agent) — not as a replacement for the baseline structure used elsewhere in this plugin.

## Core Structure

Every agent system prompt should follow this proven structure:

```markdown
You are [specific role] specializing in [specific domain].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Primary responsibility - the main task]
2. [Secondary responsibility - supporting task]
3. [Additional responsibilities as needed]

**[Task Name] Process:**
1. [First concrete step]
2. [Second concrete step]
3. [Continue with clear steps]
[...]

**Quality Standards:**
- [Standard 1 with specifics]
- [Standard 2 with specifics]
- [Standard 3 with specifics]

**Output Format:**
Provide results structured as:
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]
- [Include specific formatting requirements]

**Edge Cases:**
Handle these situations:
- [Edge case 1]: [Specific handling approach]
- [Edge case 2]: [Specific handling approach]
```

## Pattern 1: Analysis Agents

For agents that analyze code, PRs, or documentation:

```markdown
You are an expert [domain] analyzer specializing in [specific analysis type].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Thoroughly analyze [what] for [specific issues]
2. Identify [patterns/problems/opportunities]
3. Provide actionable recommendations

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Gather Context**: Read [what] using available tools
2. **Initial Scan**: Identify obvious [issues/patterns]
3. **Deep Analysis**: Examine [specific aspects]:
   - [Aspect 1]: Check for [criteria]
   - [Aspect 2]: Verify [criteria]
   - [Aspect 3]: Assess [criteria]
4. **Synthesize Findings**: Group related issues
5. **Prioritize**: Rank by [severity/impact/urgency]
6. **Generate Report**: Format according to output template

**Quality Standards:**
- Every finding includes file:line reference
- Issues categorized by severity (critical/major/minor)
- Recommendations are specific and actionable
- Positive observations included for balance

**Output Format:**
## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

## Critical Issues
- [file:line] - [Issue description] - [Recommendation]

## Major Issues
[...]

## Minor Issues
[...]

## Recommendations
[...]

**Edge Cases:**
- No issues found: Provide positive feedback and validation
- Too many issues: Group and prioritize top 10
- Unclear code: Request clarification rather than guessing
```

## Pattern 2: Generation Agents

For agents that create code, tests, or documentation:

```markdown
You are an expert [domain] engineer specializing in creating high-quality [output type].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Generate [what] that meets [quality standards]
2. Follow [specific conventions/patterns]
3. Ensure [correctness/completeness/clarity]

**Generation Process:**
1. **Understand Requirements**: Analyze what needs to be created
2. **Gather Context**: Read existing [code/docs/tests] for patterns
3. **Design Structure**: Plan [architecture/organization/flow]
4. **Generate Content**: Create [output] following:
   - [Convention 1]
   - [Convention 2]
   - [Best practice 1]
5. **Validate**: Verify [correctness/completeness]
6. **Document**: Add comments/explanations as needed

**Quality Standards:**
- Follows project conventions (check CLAUDE.md)
- [Specific quality metric 1]
- [Specific quality metric 2]
- Includes error handling
- Well-documented and clear

**Output Format:**
Create [what] with:
- [Structure requirement 1]
- [Structure requirement 2]
- Clear, descriptive naming
- Comprehensive coverage

**Edge Cases:**
- Insufficient context: Ask user for clarification
- Conflicting patterns: Follow most recent/explicit pattern
- Complex requirements: Break into smaller pieces
```

## Pattern 3: Validation Agents

For agents that validate, check, or verify:

```markdown
You are an expert [domain] validator specializing in ensuring [quality aspect].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Validate [what] against [criteria]
2. Identify violations and issues
3. Provide clear pass/fail determination

**Validation Process:**
1. **Load Criteria**: Understand validation requirements
2. **Scan Target**: Read [what] needs validation
3. **Check Rules**: For each rule:
   - [Rule 1]: [Validation method]
   - [Rule 2]: [Validation method]
4. **Collect Violations**: Document each failure with details
5. **Assess Severity**: Categorize issues
6. **Determine Result**: Pass only if [criteria met]

**Quality Standards:**
- All violations include specific locations
- Severity clearly indicated
- Fix suggestions provided
- No false positives

**Output Format:**
## Validation Result: [PASS/FAIL]

## Summary
[Overall assessment]

## Violations Found: [count]
### Critical ([count])
- [Location]: [Issue] - [Fix]

### Warnings ([count])
- [Location]: [Issue] - [Fix]

## Recommendations
[How to fix violations]

**Edge Cases:**
- No violations: Confirm validation passed
- Too many violations: Group by type, show top 20
- Ambiguous rules: Document uncertainty, request clarification
```

## Pattern 4: Orchestration Agents

For agents that coordinate multiple tools or steps:

```markdown
You are an expert [domain] orchestrator specializing in coordinating [complex workflow].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Coordinate [multi-step process]
2. Manage [resources/tools/dependencies]
3. Ensure [successful completion/integration]

**Orchestration Process:**
1. **Plan**: Understand full workflow and dependencies
2. **Prepare**: Set up prerequisites
3. **Execute Phases**:
   - Phase 1: [What] using [tools]
   - Phase 2: [What] using [tools]
   - Phase 3: [What] using [tools]
4. **Monitor**: Track progress and handle failures
5. **Verify**: Confirm successful completion
6. **Report**: Provide comprehensive summary

**Quality Standards:**
- Each phase completes successfully
- Errors handled gracefully
- Progress reported to user
- Final state verified

**Output Format:**
## Workflow Execution Report

### Completed Phases
- [Phase]: [Result]

### Results
- [Output 1]
- [Output 2]

### Next Steps
[If applicable]

**Edge Cases:**
- Phase failure: Attempt retry, then report and stop
- Missing dependencies: Request from user
- Timeout: Report partial completion
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice

**Use second person (addressing the agent):**
```
✅ You are responsible for...
✅ You will analyze...
✅ Your process should...

❌ The agent is responsible for...
❌ This agent will analyze...
❌ I will analyze...
```

### Clarity and Specificity

**Be specific, not vague:**
```
✅ Check for SQL injection by examining all database queries for parameterization
❌ Look for security issues

✅ Provide file:line references for each finding
❌ Show where issues are

✅ Categorize as critical (security), major (bugs), or minor (style)
❌ Rate the severity of issues
```

### Actionable Instructions

**Give concrete steps:**
```
✅ Read the file using the Read tool, then search for patterns using Grep
❌ Analyze the code

✅ Generate test file at test/path/to/file.test.ts
❌ Create tests
```

## Encourage Parallel Tool Calls

Recommend that the agent batch independent tool calls into a single response instead of issuing them one at a time. Include an explicit line in the prompt, e.g.:

```
When you need to read multiple files, issue all the Read calls in a single
response rather than one at a time.
```

This is a performance recommendation, not a correctness requirement — omitting it doesn't break the agent, but including it measurably reduces round trips for multi-file or multi-lookup tasks.

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Vague Responsibilities

```markdown
**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Help the user with their code
2. Provide assistance
3. Be helpful
```

**Why bad:** Not specific enough to guide behavior.

### ✅ Specific Responsibilities

```markdown
**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Analyze TypeScript code for type safety issues
2. Identify missing type annotations and improper 'any' usage
3. Recommend specific type improvements with examples
```

### ❌ Missing Process Steps

```markdown
Analyze the code and provide feedback.
```

**Why bad:** Agent doesn't know HOW to analyze.

### ✅ Clear Process

```markdown
**Analysis Process:**
1. Read code files using Read tool
2. Scan for type annotations on all functions
3. Check for 'any' type usage
4. Verify generic type parameters
5. List findings with file:line references
```

### ❌ Undefined Output

```markdown
Provide a report.
```

**Why bad:** Agent doesn't know what format to use.

### ✅ Defined Output Format

```markdown
**Output Format:**
## Type Safety Report

### Summary
[Overview of findings]

### Issues Found
- `file.ts:42` - Missing return type on `processData`
- `utils.ts:15` - Unsafe 'any' usage in parameter

### Recommendations
[Specific fixes with examples]
```

## Length Guidelines

### Minimum Viable Agent

**~500 words minimum:**
- Role description
- 3 core responsibilities
- 5-step process
- Output format

### Standard Agent

**~1,000-2,000 words:**
- Detailed role and expertise
- 5-8 responsibilities
- 8-12 process steps
- Quality standards
- Output format
- 3-5 edge cases

### Comprehensive Agent

**~2,000-5,000 words:**
- Complete role with background
- Comprehensive responsibilities
- Detailed multi-phase process
- Extensive quality standards
- Multiple output formats
- Many edge cases
- Examples within system prompt

**Avoid > 10,000 words:** Too long, diminishing returns.

## Testing System Prompts

### Test Completeness

Can the agent handle these based on system prompt alone?

- [ ] Typical task execution
- [ ] Edge cases mentioned
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] Unclear requirements
- [ ] Large/complex inputs
- [ ] Empty/missing inputs

### Test Clarity

Read the system prompt and ask:

- Can another developer understand what this agent does?
- Are process steps clear and actionable?
- Is output format unambiguous?
- Are quality standards measurable?

### Iterate Based on Results

After testing agent:
1. Identify where it struggled
2. Add missing guidance to system prompt
3. Clarify ambiguous instructions
4. Add process steps for edge cases
5. Re-test

## Conclusion

Effective system prompts are:
- **Specific**: Clear about what and how
- **Structured**: Organized with clear sections
- **Complete**: Covers normal and edge cases
- **Actionable**: Provides concrete steps
- **Testable**: Defines measurable standards

Use the patterns above as templates, customize for your domain, and iterate based on agent performance.
